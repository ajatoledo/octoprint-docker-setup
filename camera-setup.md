# Persist Printer and Camera Connections in Octoprint Across Reboots

## Challenges in Managing Printer and Camera Connections Across Reboots

**Background**

I use [Octoprint](https://octoprint.org/) as my webserver to manage multiple 3D printers with cameras on an x86 machine. Rather than create separate Octoprint instances on the host, I run *multiple* Octoprint [docker containers](https://hub.docker.com/r/octoprint/octoprint)

For reference, system specs for my host are provided below:

- **System Specs**

    + **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS x86_64
    + **Kernel**: 5.15.0-56-generic
    + **CPU**: Intel i3-8145U (4) @ 3.900GHz
    + **Memory**: 3790MiB

**Problem**

TTY are randomly assigned to devices at boot, causing depending services/programs instabilities. So they could indeed fail to start because of different TTY configurations.

As a result, my camera streams using `mjpg-stream`, and my 3D-printer mappings are *always* wrong after a reboot.

**Solution**

- Assign immutable TTY names to USB devices by creating symbolic links of physical devices

- Configure then services/programs to point to these symbolic TTYs

- Configure a `systemd` process that starts at boot to activate `mjpg-streamer` camera streams
    
    + **Note**: `mjpg-streamer` is *challenging* [to install](https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer), so to simplify the process, the [snap version](https://snapcraft.io/mjpg-streamer) is used. Therefore, [snapd](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd) is required

**WARNING**: `mjpg-streamer` should not be used on untrusted networks! By default, anyone with access to the network that `mjpg-streamer` is running on will be able to access it

---

### Verify User Permissions

For the following steps, users will need both `sudo` and `video` permissions.

- To see the groups a user has access to enter: `groups $USER`

- If a `sudo` and/or `video` are missing, follow the steps below

**Add User to Sudoers**

- To add a user to `sudo`, run the command, `usermod -aG sudo username` as root or another sudo user

    + Check out this [page](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-add-user-to-sudoers-in-ubuntu/) for a more detailed discussion of `sudo` permissions

**Add User to Video**

- To add a user to `video`, run the command, `sudo usermod -a -G video username`

üìù Make sure you change ‚Äúusername‚Äù with the name of the user that you want to grant permissions to

**Verify Group Updates**

- To see if the group(s) updated successfully enter: `groups $USER`

    + If the new group(s) isn't listed, then log out and log back in
    
    + Once logged back in, enter: `groups $USER`, and the updated group(s) should be visible

### List Camera Connections

**Required Packages**:

- `v4l-utils`

- `ffmpeg` - used for advanced testing

**List Cameras**

1. If `v4l-utils` and `ffmpeg` are already installed, move to **Step 2**, otherwise install `v4l-utils` and `ffmpeg`; enter this command: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install v4l-utils ffmpeg -y`

2. List cameras, `v4l2-ctl --list-devices`

Returns output similar to what is shown below:

```
C270 HD WEBCAM (usb-0000:00:14.0-1):
    /dev/video0
    /dev/video1
    /dev/media0

C270 HD WEBCAM (usb-0000:00:14.0-3):
    /dev/video2
    /dev/video3
    /dev/media1
```

3. For additional camera actions, review this [StackExchange Post](https://askubuntu.com/questions/348838/how-to-check-available-webcams-from-the-command-line)

---

### List Printer Serial Connections

**Required Packages**:

- `python3.10-venv`

- `pyserial`

**Install `pyserial` and Identify USB Printers**

1. If `pyserial` is already installed and is available in the environment, skip to **Step 6**; otherwise proceed

2. Create a python environment, into which pyserial will be installed; below is an example

    1. If `venv` is installed, move to **Step ii**, otherwise run this command: `sudo apt install python3.10-venv`

    2. `mkdir tools`

    3. `python3 -m venv tools`
    
    4. Activate the new python environment using the following command: `source tools/bin/activate`. If successful, a `(tools)` should appear to the left of the username in the shell
        
        1. If the activation was not successful, review the path passed above to ensure it is correct; the following steps will not work unless the environment is active

4. Install `pyserial` using the following command: `pip install pyserial`

6. Run `python -m serial.tools.miniterm`

7. Review output; enter `CTRL` + `C` to exit

Returns output similar to what is shown below:

```
--- Available ports:
---  1: /dev/ttyACM0         'Original Prusa i3 MK3'
---  2: /dev/ttyACM1         'Original Prusa MINI'
---  3: /dev/ttyS0           'ttyS0'
---  4: /dev/ttyS1           'ttyS1'
--- Enter port index or full name:
```

*If there are multiple printers, there may be duplicated names. While there are ways to test, probably the easiest is to plug in one at a time and then use the steps below to create a symlink to map the USB*

- [Reference](https://pyserial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools.html)

---

## Create USB Symlink Mappings

The steps below will create udev rules that will create symlinks that users can reference and result in consistent device mappings 

- `/udev/video*` and `/udev/tty*` mappings can change on each reboot which means printers and cameras may not appear reliably

### `udevadm` Overview

- The `udevadm` command is a device management tool in Linux that manages all the device events and controls the udevd daemon 

- Udev rules are defined with the .rules file in `/usr/lib/udev/rules.d`; the syntax for the `udevadm` command are provided below:

```
udevadm [--debug] [--version] [--help]
udevadm info options
udevadm trigger [options]
udevadm settle [options]
udevadm control command
udevadm monitor [options]
udevadm test [options] devpath

```

- [Source](https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/linux/udevadm-command)

---

#### `udevadm info`

- Udevadm info starts with the device specified by the devpath and then
walks up the chain of parent devices 

- It prints for every device found, all possible attributes in the udev rules key format

- A rule to match will be composed of the attributes of the device
and the attributes from one single parent device

- To *walk* the attributes of a webcam located at `/dev/video0`, run the following command: `/dev/video0`: `udevadm info --name=/dev/video0 --attribute-walk`

The command should return output similar to what is shown below:

```
Udevadm info starts with the device specified by the devpath and then
walks up the chain of parent devices. It prints, for every device
found, all possible attributes in the `udev` rules key format.
A rule to match can be composed of the attributes of the device
and the attributes from one single parent device.

  looking at device '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:14.0/usb1/1-1/1-1:1.0/video4linux/video0':
    KERNEL=="video0"
    SUBSYSTEM=="video4linux"
    DRIVER==""
    ATTR{dev_debug}=="0"
    ATTR{index}=="0"
    ATTR{name}=="C270 HD WEBCAM"
    ATTR{power/async}=="disabled"
    ATTR{power/control}=="auto"
    ATTR{power/runtime_active_kids}=="0"
    ATTR{power/runtime_active_time}=="0"
    ATTR{power/runtime_enabled}=="disabled"
    ATTR{power/runtime_status}=="unsupported"
    ATTR{power/runtime_suspended_time}=="0"
    ATTR{power/runtime_usage}=="0"

--- truncated
```

- If an error is returned, it likely indicates that no webcam is found at the `/dev/video0`; to get a listing of all connected webcams, run the following command: `ls /dev | grep video*` to get a list of connected webcams

**Using Serial Number Attribute**

The attribute output provides a detailed listing of attributes; however, my mappings use the serial number attribute and work well, so to limit the output returned, use the following command:

- `udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyACM0 --attribute-walk | grep serial` which produces less information 

- Below is an example of the output created

```
    ATTRS{serial}=="SERIAL_XXXXXXXXXX"
    ATTRS{serial}=="SERIAL_XXXXXXXXXX"
```

- Run this command on `/dev/video0`: `udevadm info --name=/dev/video0 --attribute-walk`

With the output, symlink rules can be created using the form presented below in the example `udev` rules

- [Source](https://gist.github.com/mspacek/96673b195fa0b16f9e20)

#### Example `udev` Rules

The rules below were created using attributes from üëÜ for both printers and cameras

```
# printer 5 - prusa mk3s - mosquito
KERNEL=="ttyACM*", ATTRS{serial}=="SERIAL_XXXXXXXXXX", SYMLINK+="prusa_5"

# camera 5
KERNEL=="video*", ATTR{index}=="0", ATTRS{serial}=="SERIAL_XXXXXXXXXX", SYMLINK+="prusa_camera_5"

# printer 6 - prusa mini
KERNEL=="ttyACM*", ATTRS{serial}=="SERIAL_XXXXXXXXXX", SYMLINK+="prusa_6"

# camera 6
KERNEL=="video*", ATTR{index}=="0", ATTRS{serial}=="SERIAL_XXXXXXXXXX", SYMLINK+="prusa_camera_6"
```

**Notes**:

- The serial number information provided above suppressed my actual serial number information, in favor of a generic string, `SERIAL_XXXXXXXXXX`; update your `udev` rules to match your serial output

- The value of `SYMLINK+=""` determines the symlink values that will be used

    + My examples above use a `prusa_` pre-fix for printers and a `prusa_camera_` pre-fix for cameras; update `SYMLINK+=""` to match your needs

---

### Add Rules to `udev`

The rules üëÜ were saved in `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb-serial.rules`

Use your preferred text editor, the example below uses [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/)

1. Enter `sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-usb-serial.rules`

2. Paste the rules created üëÜ in the editor window

3. After adding rules, enter `CTRL` + `O` to save the file, and then hit `ENTER`

4. To close the file, enter `CTRL` + `X`

---

### Trigger Rules

To trigger the new udev rules, run the following: `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger`

- To verify that the new device symlinks are present, run `ls -l /dev/prusa*`, the symlink names should appear in the list


```
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root             7 Dec 28 19:31 prusa_5 -> ttyACM0
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root             7 Dec 28 19:31 prusa_6 -> ttyACM1
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root             6 Dec 28 19:31 prusa_camera_5 -> video2
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root             6 Dec 28 19:31 prusa_camera_6 -> video0
```

**Note**: the ls command above returned items using my custom symlink names which each included `prusa` as part of the process. Therefore, if different symlink names are used, update the ls command accordingly

## Install `mjpg-streamer`

The steps below install `mjpg-streamer` using the ubuntu snap package. There are alternative approaches for installing `mjpg-streamer` [1](https://github.com/john-clark/mjpg-streamer-setup), [2](https://www.acmesystems.it/video_streaming), but I have not tested/verified whether they work, so *YMMV*.

### Installing via Snap

Installation is easy, run the two steps below.

- Snap Install: `sudo snap install mjpg-streamer`

- Update Snap Permissions for Camera: `sudo snap connect mjpg-streamer:camera`

    + [Snap Source Page](https://snapcraft.io/mjpg-streamer)

## Start Camera Stream(s)

The examples below outline open a camera stream using `mjpg-streamer` 

*I haven't found detailed documentation for `mjpg-streamer`, but this [page](http://skillfulness.blogspot.com/2010/03/mjpg-streamer-documentation.html) was helpful*

### Open A Stream For A Single Camera

- command: `sudo mjpg-streamer -i "input_uvc.so -d /dev/prusa_camera_5 -r 1280x720" -o "output_http.so -p 8081"`

    + Camera: `/dev/prusa_camera_5`
    + Resolution: 1280x720
    + Web Server: output_http.so
    + Port: 8081

To view output, visit the following links

- Stream URL: http://localhost:8081/?action=snapshot
- Snapshot URL: http://localhost:8081/?action=stream

**Note**: `localhost` will need to be replaced with the host's local ip address so that they can be accessed by other users on the network. This is necessary if hosting Octoprint using Docker

### Open Multiple Camera Streams
    
- command: `mjpg-streamer -i "input_uvc.so -d /dev/prusa_camera_5 -r 1280x720" -i "input_uvc.so -d /dev/prusa_camera_6 -r 1280x720" -o "output_http.so -p 8081"`

    + Camera_0: `/dev/prusa_camera_5`
    + Camera_1: `/dev/prusa_camera_6`
    + Resolution: 1280x720
    + Web Server: output_http.so
    + Port: 8081

*For multiple cameras, the feeds are output in the order they were input and starting at zero*

- Camera_0 Stream: http://localhost:8081/?action=stream_0
- Camera_1 Stream: http://localhost:8081/?action=stream_1
- Snapshot_0 URL: http://localhost:8081/?action=stream_0
- Snapshot_1 URL: http://localhost:8081/?action=stream_1

**Note**: `localhost` will need to be replaced with the host's local ip address so that they can be accessed by other users on the network. This is necessary if hosting Octoprint using Docker

## Bash Script to Activate Camera Stream

Creating a simple BASH script to activate the camera streams via `mjpg-streamer` makes activating the stream easy.

### Example Camera Stream Script

Below is an example Bash script

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# since there are multiple cameras, there will be multiple inputs for mjpg-streamer
# the feeds are then output in the order they were input and start at zero

# so, in the example below:

mjpg-streamer -i "input_uvc.so -d /dev/prusa_camera_5 -r 1280x720" -i "input_uvc.so -d /dev/prusa_camera_6 -r 1280x720" -o "output_http.so -p 8081"

# argument listing for clarity, don't need to update and can delete

# Camera_0: `/dev/prusa_camera_5`
# Camera_1: `/dev/prusa_camera_6`
# Resolution: 1280x720
# Web Server: output_http.so
# Port: 8081

# camera_5 stream: http://localhost:8081/?action=stream_0
# camera_6 stream: http://localhost:8081/?action=stream_1

# reference:
# https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer/issues/186
# https://github.com/jacksonliam/mjpg-streamer/blob/master/mjpg-streamer-experimental/plugins/output_http/README.md
```

### Create Script to Activate Camera Stream

1. Enter `sudo nano /usr/local/bin/camera-stream`

2. Paste the materials from the example script üëÜ; 

    1. *Be sure to update to match your own system.*

3. After adding the information for the script, enter `CTRL` + `O` to save the file, and then hit `ENTER`

4. To close the file, enter `CTRL` + `X`

5. Make the script executable by entering: `sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/camera-stream`

## `systemd` Service

Create a `systemd` process file used to create the camera feed service, which can be launched at boot

**Note**: `mjpg-streamer` is a snap package, users can use a [snap daemon](https://snapcraft.io/docs/services-and-daemons), but I prefer systemd. The steps below use systemd

### Example `systemd` Service

```
[Unit]
Description=mjpg-streamer camera feeds

[Service]
Restart=always
RestartSec=1
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/camera-stream
ExecStop=killall mjpg_streamer

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Note**: if you save your camera script using a name different than `camera-stream` or to a different location that `/usr/local/bin`, update the `ExecStart` line in the service file above accordingly 

---

### Create `systemd` Service

1. Enter `sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/printer-stream.service`

2. Paste the materials from the example process üëÜ

    1. *Be sure to update to match your system.*

3. After adding the information for the script, enter `CTRL` + `O` to save the file, and then hit `ENTER`

4. To close the file, enter `CTRL` + `X`

5. To start the process, enter `sudo systemctl start printer-stream.service`
    
    1. To check whether the process started successfully, enter `sudo systemctl status printer-stream.service`
        
        1. If the status indicates that the process failed, check the `journalctl` for any errors. Depending on how long your system has been up, there may be a lot of log information to review. Running `journalctl -b | grep printer-stream` will limit the log information to the current boot, which should make checking output for troubleshooting easier
        
        2. For additional `journalctl` information consider reviewing these sites, [1](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-journalctl-to-view-and-manipulate-systemd-logs) and [2](https://linuxhint.com/journalctl-tail-and-cheatsheet/)
    
6. The `printer-stream.service` process will not persist across reboots, but setting it to start at boot is easy; enter `sudo systemctl enable printer-stream.service`

## FAQ

**I don't see all of my cameras, what's up?**

While the steps above don't account for all specific system setups, presuming you tested the `mjpg-streamer` script above and it started, the issue may be with the [PCIe bandwidth available on your system](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/2-usb-cameras-work-but-not-3.124695/post-465302). 

For example, I initially plugged four cameras into a single, powered USB 3.0 hub and could not get all of my cameras to appear. However, I could see the streams after I moved two cameras to different USB ports.
